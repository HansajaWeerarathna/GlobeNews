# Building a Modern News Website Without Code 🤯

I've been exploring Cursor AI and v0 by Vercel, which led me to create a functional news website using the GNews API 📰. The platform offers users instant access to global news in one convenient location, with browsing capabilities across various categories including Sports, World News, Politics, Entertainment, and more.

## Tools Used

### 1. Planning with O1 🧠
- Started by outlining project requirements, desired features, and tech stack
- Used O1 to generate detailed file structure and tailored development workflow

### 2. Development with Cursor AI 💻
- Generated required code using Cursor AI
- Handled error resolution
- Created basic user interface
- Simplified the overall development process

### 3. UI Enhancement with V0 🎨
- Added sleek animations and modern design elements
- Improved visual appeal and dynamics
- Enhanced user experience without writing code

## Key Features 🔑

- **Next.js Caching**: Optimized data fetching for super-fast performance
- **Type-Safe Development**: Built with TypeScript for reliability
- **Responsive Design**: Perfect compatibility across all screen sizes
- **Dark Mode + Modern Animations**: Trendy, sleek, and user-friendly interface
